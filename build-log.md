# Dropit App Build Log

## 2024-01-17 - Navigation and Environment Setup

### 🔧 What was done

#### Project Setup

- Created new Expo project with TypeScript template
- Initialized project structure with key directories
- Installed core dependencies for navigation, styling, and data management

#### Files Created/Modified

- 📂 `App.tsx` - Root application component with navigation setup
- 📂 `navigation/`
  - `RootNavigator.tsx` - Stack navigator configuration
  - `TabNavigator.tsx` - Bottom tab navigator setup
  - `types.ts` - Navigation type definitions
- 📂 `screens/`
  - `HomeScreen.tsx` - Home tab screen
  - `OrdersScreen.tsx` - Orders tab screen
  - `ProfileScreen.tsx` - Profile tab screen
- 📂 `utils/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- 📂 `app.config.js` - Expo configuration with environment variables
- 📂 `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### 🧠 Internal Decisions

- Using Expo's StatusBar component instead of React Native's for better TypeScript support
- Tab navigation colors set to sky blue (#0ea5e9) for active and slate (#64748b) for inactive
- Headers hidden by default in both stack and tab navigators
- Environment variables managed through Expo's configuration system

### ⚠️ Security & Risk Notes

- Supabase credentials need to be properly configured
- No authentication flow implemented yet
- No route protection for sensitive screens
- AsyncStorage usage needs security review
- Missing error boundaries and loading states
- Environment variables need proper setup in production

### 🔜 Next Steps

#### High Priority

- Add authentication screens (login, signup, password reset)
- Implement navigation guards for protected routes
- Add tab icons and screen headers
- Set up proper error handling

#### Medium Priority

- Configure deep linking
- Add loading states to navigation
- Implement modal screens for alerts
- Add proper TypeScript types for all navigation params

#### Low Priority

- Add screen transitions
- Optimize tab bar performance
- Add navigation event logging

### Notes

- Using TypeScript for better type safety and development experience
- Following React Native best practices for project structure
- Using functional components and hooks exclusively

## 2024-01-17 - Splash and Welcome Screens Implementation

### 🔧 What was done

#### Screen Implementation

- Created SplashScreen with yellow background (#FFD95A) and centered logo
- Created WelcomeScreen matching the provided design specifications
- Updated navigation flow: Splash → Welcome → Main App
- Added proper TypeScript navigation types

#### Files Created/Modified

- 📂 `screens/SplashScreen.tsx` - Splash screen with 2-second auto-navigation
- 📂 `screens/WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Welcome screen matching design layout
- 📂 `navigation/types.ts` - Added new screen types (Splash, Welcome, Main)
- 📂 `navigation/RootNavigator.tsx` - Updated navigation stack order

### 🧠 Internal Decisions

- Used `navigation.replace()` instead of `navigate()` to prevent back navigation to splash
- Implemented 2-second timer with cleanup in useEffect for splash screen
- Used inline styles for specific colors (#FFD95A) that don't have Tailwind equivalents
- Set image dimensions using Tailwind classes for consistency
- Both "Get Started" and "Skip for now" buttons navigate to Main app (temporary)

### ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations

- **Font Assumption**: Using system default fonts since custom fonts not specified
- **Image Assets**: Assuming logo and welcome images exist in `/assets/` directory
- **Navigation Flow**: Welcome screen buttons navigate to Main app (will change when auth is added)
- **Responsive Design**: Fixed image sizes may need adjustment for different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: No accessibility labels added yet (should be added in future)

### 🔜 Next Steps

#### High Priority
- Add authentication screens (Login/Signup) when designs are provided
- Update Welcome screen navigation to point to auth flow
- Add proper error handling for missing image assets

#### Medium Priority
- Add custom fonts if brand fonts are specified
- Implement responsive image sizing
- Add accessibility labels and screen reader support
- Add loading states for image assets

#### Low Priority
- Add subtle animations to splash screen
- Implement onboarding slides if multiple screens needed
- Add haptic feedback to buttons

### 📝 Technical Notes

- Navigation stack now: `Splash → Welcome → Main (TabNavigator)`
- All screens use SafeAreaView for proper device compatibility
- TypeScript types properly extended for new navigation structure
- Image assets referenced using `require()` for proper bundling
